# vimrc-everyday-commands
vimrc is a settings file usually used by vim in linux environment. This file contains the initialization commands for the vim,
and located at ~/.vimrc. When the vim starts, it pulls up the default config options from ~/.vimrc and applies to your editor 
as the default behavior.

In this repo, I will try to aggregate the all the useful vim commands which I use everyday into the single .vimrc file. So 
that, whenever I am switching my developer machine, I can copy this .vimrc file and start working in the same way on my new 
environment. As I have a plan to add all the useful commands, I can also look into my .vimrc file whenever I forgot a command 
instead of searching on the web every time.
